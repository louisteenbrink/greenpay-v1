# Pre-requisites

1. Read the [Google Pay Android Brand Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/brand-guidelines)
2. Follow Google Pay's [Deploy production environment guidelines](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/deploy-production-environment). In this step you will obtain a **merchantID**. By integrating Google Pay, you agree to Google's [terms of service](https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/sellertos).
3. Contact the [Fat Zebra support team](mailto:support@fatzebra.com) to have Google Pay enabled on your account. You will be supplied a **gatewayMerchantID**. 

# Implementation Steps

Follow the instructions in the following Google guides to implement a Google Pay button in your app:

- [Google Pay Android developer documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/)
- [Google Pay Android integration checklist](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/test-and-deploy/integration-checklist)

When setting up the _tokenizationSpecification_ object, specify the following values for the **gateway** and **gatewayMerchantId** values:

```java
private static JSONObject getTokenizationSpecification() {
  JSONObject tokenizationSpecification = new JSONObject();
  tokenizationSpecification.put("type", "PAYMENT_GATEWAY");
  tokenizationSpecification.put(
      "parameters",
      new JSONObject()
          .put("gateway", "fatzebra")
          .put("gatewayMerchantId", "<provided to you by Fat Zebra>"));

  return tokenizationSpecification;
}
```

The Google Pay button will generate an encrypted token that you must then include in a request to the Fat Zebra API to:

- Create a purchase using the card in the Google Pay payload
- Or tokenize the card details in the Google Pay payload

The following documentation outlines the format of the two API calls:

- [Create a purchase using a wallet](ref:create-a-purchase-with-wallet)
- [Tokenize a card with wallet credentials](ref:tokenize-a-card-with-wallet-credentials)
