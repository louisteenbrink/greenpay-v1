This article provides instructions detailing how to setup an Apple Merchant ID for Apple Pay.

An Apple Merchant ID is an identifier you register with Apple that uniquely identifies your business as a merchant able to accept payments. This ID never expires, and can be used in multiple websites and iOS apps and in multiple environments (testing and production).

# Request Merchant Identifier and Certificates from Fat Zebra

Contact your Fat Zebra account representative to get onboarded onto our Apple Pay integration. We will provide you with the following:

- A **Merchant Identifier** that you will need to setup your Apple Merchant ID
- A **Payment Processing Certificate** which you will need to add to the Apple Merchant ID you setup in the previous step. Apple will use this certificate to encrypt transaction data. This file will have a name ending with _-applepay.csr_.
- (_Apple Pay on the Web merchants only_) A **Merchant Identity Certificate** which you will need to upload to Apple when setting up your Apple Merchant IDs. Apple will use this certificate to authenticate your web sessions with the Apple Pay servers when using Apple Pay on the Web. This file will have a name ending with _-applepay-web.csr_.
