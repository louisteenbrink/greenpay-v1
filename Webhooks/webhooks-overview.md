A Webhook is an out of band communications mechanism which allows our systems to sent events to external systems, such as the notification of a payment, batch file completion, etc.

Normally webhooks are used where notifications from an automated or asynchronous process are required, or if additional systems (apart from the one interacting with the gateway) require notification of events.
