Authentication with the Fat Zebra API is via HTTP Basic Authentication. When your account is setup you are provided with two sets of credentials - one for the test environment (also known as the Sandbox), and one for the live system. Your test username will always be prefixed with `TEST`.

API requests must be made over HTTPS - any requests over HTTP will fail. All requests require authentication.

> ðŸš§ Note:
> 
> It is important to note that your username is not case sensitive however your API token (password) is.

```curl
$ curl https://gateway.pmnts-sandbox.io/v1.0/purchases -u TEST:TEST
```
