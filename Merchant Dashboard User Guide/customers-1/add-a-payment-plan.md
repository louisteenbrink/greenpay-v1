3. Select between "Recurring subscriptions" or "Instalments"
   1. Recurring subscriptions are for ongoing subscriptions, potentially without an end date in mind. Think of this like your streaming subscriptions or gym memberships.
   2. Instalments are used when a customer is due to pay off total amount over a particular period of time. Think of this like a buy-now-pay-later setup, paying off $500 over 4 monthly instalments of $125 each month.
4. Fill out the remaining payment plan details.
5. Click "Create Payment Plan"
