You will be able to view a list of the daily settlement amounts within your date range. Amex and Diners will appear in separate columns to allow you to reconcile these amounts when they are settled into your bank account.

The settlement summary report provides a ‘View’ option that provides a breakdown of transactions by card type. You can also download an individual transaction report when viewing a settlement day.
