> AVS checks are currently only supported by a limited number of acquirers. If the AVS fields are used where support is not yet available, the transactions will process as normal and return an `avs_result_code` of `101` which indicates that AVS is not supported.

AVS (Address Verirfication System) is a service that combats fraudulent activity by verifying a cardholder's address information against the card issuer's records.

AVS is currently supported by Fat Zebra on Purchases via the `billing_address` field. If this field is specified, the Fat Zebra API will return an `avs_result_code` field indicating the result of the AVS check.

The following `avs_result_code` values may be returned:
