> ðŸš§ Limited Acquirer Support For Payment Aggregators
> 
> Processing transactions as a Payment Aggregator is not supported by all Australian acquirers. If these methods are used where support is not yet available the transactions may be declined or return errors. Contact the Fat Zebra support team for more information.

The Payment Aggregator fields allow merchants who act as a Payment Aggregator to specify sub-merchant details required by their acquirers. This is currently only supported for a handful of banks, and must be enabled before use by contacting the Fat Zebra support team.

Payment Aggregator fields are specified in the field **sub_merchant** of type **Hash**. They can be specified on authorisation, purchase, and refund transactions.
