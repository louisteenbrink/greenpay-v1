When a chargeback occurs, Fat Zebra receives a notification of the chargeback and sends you an automated email about it. 

You can subscribe to webhooks for chargeback notifications. Each time our system receives a notification or update, a webhook will be sent containing information on the current and previous notifications related to the chargeback, newest notification first.
