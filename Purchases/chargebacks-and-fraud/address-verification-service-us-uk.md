## How AVS Works.

The Address Verification Service is a system that verifies the numeric portion of a cardholder’s address. For instance, if John Smith’s is making a purchase and plugs in his address as 1304 Main Street, Anytown, Illinois, 60473, the AVS will compare the numbers 1304 and/or 60473 with the address on file with the card issuer. The merchant is notified as to whether the numbers match or not, helping the merchant to make the wisest decision possible about authorizing a transaction.
