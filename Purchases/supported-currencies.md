Fat Zebra supports processing payments in 100+ currencies. This is especially helpful if you have a global presence, as charging in a customerâ€™s native currency can increase sales.

The currency used comes into play in three places:

- The customerâ€™s credit card currency
- The currency of the charge, called the presentment currency
- The currency accepted by your destination bank account or debit card, called the settlement       currency

If the charge currency differs from the customerâ€™s credit card currency, the customer may be charged a foreign exchange fee by their credit card company. The customer may also be charged a fee by their credit card company if the credit card and your business are in different countries, regardless of the currency used.

> ğŸš§ Please ensure your acquirer supports the currencies you require.
