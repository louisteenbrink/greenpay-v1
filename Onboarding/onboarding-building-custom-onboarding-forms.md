The APIs are designed in a way that you, a FatZebraâ€™s partner, can retain full control over the look and feel of the onboarding form seen by your merchants. The interaction and state management of the application are entirely in your hand. The only point of time that your system would call FatZebra Onboarding API is when merchants upload an image for a supporting document or when all the data are curated and ready for submission.

Your onboarding form frontend and backend are responsible for constructing the Merchant Application Request object.
