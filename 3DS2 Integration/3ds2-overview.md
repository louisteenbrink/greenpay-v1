3DS2 is a payments industry standard that promotes secure, frictionless consumer authentication for online payments. 3DS2 allows you to reduce fraud by providing methods to verify the authenticity of online payments.

The steps required to implement 3DS2 using Fat Zebra will depend on:

1. If you have already have an MPI (Merchant Plug-in) or require Fat Zebra to act as your MPI
2. Your PCI level
3. Your preferred integration method

# MPI

### I already have an MPI

If you have an existing MPI integration you will need to follow your MPI's instructions in order to authenticate a payment transaction. After authentication your MPI will provide you with 3DS data which may include:

- Cryptogram, CAV, CAVV or AAV
- Ecommerce Indicator (ECI) or Security Level Indicator (SLI)
- PARes
- VERes

You will then need to set the [3D Secure fields](doc:3d-secure) on your Fat Zebra Purchase or Refund API calls in order to complete a 3DS2 transaction.

### I don't have an MPI

Fat Zebra can act as your MPI. Please contact your Fat Zebra representative for more information on how to add Fat Zebra's 3DS2 MPI to your account.

Using Fat Zebra's MPI, there are various integration methods to choose from depending on your PCI level:
