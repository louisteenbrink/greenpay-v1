Each card scheme recommends merchants to display their 3DS2 product logos on their payment pages where possible. These product logos include:

- Verified by Visa
- Mastercard ID Check
- Amex SafeKey

If you are integrating 3DS2 using Fat Zebra's [Hosted Payments Page](doc:using-hosted-payments-page), please note that the Hosted Payments Page does not display these logos for you in order to give you control of the placement of these logos.
