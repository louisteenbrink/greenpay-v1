| Frictionless     | Customer is not made aware of the successful 3DS2 event.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Challenged       | The customer is challenged to prove legitimate access to the payment method. A pop up window is displayed to the customer, asking them to authenticate their credentials. This is usually completed via SMS. |
| Unsuccessful     | Rejected by the issuer                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Unavailable      | 3DS2 service is unavailable or the merchant has not been registered correctly for 3DS2.                                                                                                                      |
| Abandoned        | The customer has abandoned their 3DS authentication by failing to enter in the passcode and navigating away or letting the session timeout.                                                                  |
| Rejected         | Authentication rejected by the issuer.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Invalid Scenario | This can occur when an older version of 3DS is used by the card issuer.                                                                                                                                      |
