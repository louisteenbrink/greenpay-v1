excerpt: "This API is used to authenticate a transaction. The first step is to call this API with sca.type = \"enrollment\" to check whether the transaction is frictionless or needs further challenge. After a successful challenge, this API should be called with sca.type = \"validation\" which will return 3DS2/SCA fields."
