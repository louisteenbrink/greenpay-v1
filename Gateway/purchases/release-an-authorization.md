> _Note_: Updating authorization, such as extending authorization windows, amending authorization amounts and performing authorization completions is currently only supported by a handful of Australian acquirers, including Westpac and FDMS (First Data Merchant Services). If these methods are used where support is not yet available the transactions may be declined or return errors.
