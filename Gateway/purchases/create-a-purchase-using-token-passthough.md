## The cryptogram object

Using a scheme token to transact a cryptogram must be provided for the first transaction.

Subsequent transactions may provide the cryptogram if required.

Fatzebra will save the the scheme token as a standard credit card record with a Fatzebra token, with a wallet type of 'Passthrough token'. Using the returned Fatzebra token, the cryptogram may be passed in.

> ðŸš§ BIN blocking based on county of origin will not be performed when using network token passthrough.
> 
> As the underlying instrument is not provided, and the network token submitted may have been generated with a BIN that corresponds to a foreign institution, BIN blocking can not be applied to transactions using network token passthrough.
