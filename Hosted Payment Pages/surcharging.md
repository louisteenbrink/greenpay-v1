Please note that Surcharging is an Australia-only feature.

This feature allows predefined surcharging rates to be automatically applied and communicated to the customer on the Hosted Payment Page. To enable Surcharging, you must be a admin user of the Merchant Dashboard. The option can be found under Admin > Account > Surcharging.
