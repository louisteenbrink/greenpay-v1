Security is our highest priority - each year we go through an audit process which covers a comprehensive set of guidelines provided by the PCI Security Standards Council.

In addition to our yearly audit we scan our infrastructure for any vulnerabilities (on our servers) and an external scanning vendor checks for any problems in our website, dashboard and gateway. All of this is part of what we do to ensure card holder data stays secure.
